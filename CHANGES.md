      (written in java)
    * Automatically reload sbt if `gen-android` is run within a repl or a
      series of commands
      * e.g., one can now do
      `sbt "gen-android com.example Hello" android:run android:test android:uninstall`
      to get a quick hello world run, running of tests and uninstallation
  * add `variantConfiguration` setting to describe current buildType and flavor
  * Improve provided proguard rules to handle `androidTest` better
  * Set the value of `debugIncludesTests` to the presence of scala source in
    `androidTest`
  * Fix `TypedRes` in the presence of `res/animator`

    defaults to enabled
  * `androidTest` is now the required configuration for adding
    dependencies to `androidTest` instrumentation tests

    fixes `gen-android` failing to run on `1.6.10`
  * Fix proguard failing when the SDK is installed to a directory
    containing spaces
* `1.6.10`:
  * Handle `extraResDirectories` and `extraAssetDirectories` when
    processing resources from dependent projects
  * Ignore duplicate `buildConfigOptions`
  * Fix inclusion of `compile-internal` artifacts into final dex/apk
  * `"test"` configuration artifacts are now included in `androidTest`
    properly
  * No longer include optional platform libraries in proguard and test
    unless added by `libraryRequests`
  * Fix incorrect string concatenation of SDK-related paths
* `1.6.9`:
  * bump default `minSdkVersion` to `19`, set explicitly if lower is required
  * Fix TR.scala lint errors
  * Improve some warnings when generating TypedViewHolders
* `1.6.8`:
  * TypedViewHolder usability improvements
    * better error messaging when `<include>` layouts are missing
    * automatically setTag on TypedViewHolder creation
    * `TypedViewHolder.from(view, TR.layout.XXX)` to retrieve a correctly
      tagged viewholder
    * when `rootView` has an associated id, create a named field for the
      `rootView`
  * consider `proguardOptions` when forcing a clean build due to config change
  * Added test cases to ensure compatibility with `sbt-structure` and `protify`
    * In order to successfully import `sbt-android` projects into IntelliJ
      until https://github.com/JetBrains/sbt-structure/pull/41 is merged,
      download
      [sbt-structure-0.13.jar](sbt-test/android-sdk-plugin/sbt-structure-compatibility/project/lib/sbt-structure-0.13.jar) from the test case
* `1.6.7`:
  * New TypedViewHolder bindings, automatically generated from layout
    XML to create type-safe and static bindings to layout views
    * `val viewholder: TypedViewHolder.XXX = TypedViewHolder.setContentView(activity, TR.layout.XXX)`
    * `val viewholder: TypedViewHolder.YYY = TypedViewHolder.inflate(inflater, TR.layout.YYY, parent, attachToParent)`
    * Limitations
      * `<fragment>` will be ignored
      * `<merge>` is treated as `android.view.View`
      * `<include>` will be assigned a viewholder val or have all of
        its views included into the viewholder, depending on whether
        an id is supplied or the root view type is compatible.
      * repeated ids will result in only 1 holder val being created.
        colliding names will otherwise have 2..99 appended automatically
      * view types with type parameters cannot be expressed directly nor
        handled. This has always been an issue with TR, workaround by
        using `<view class="viewTypeWithParameter">`. As a result
        `<view class=...>` will not be processed for the class name and
        will resolve to `android.view.View`
      * IntelliJ will not properly recognize that the `TypedViewHolder`
        is correctly typed, force a type ascription as above and ignore
        the resulting error highlight rather than allowing IntelliJ to
        infer, see
        [SCL-10491](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/SCL-10491)
      * This is compilation-time binding only. Any runtime layout
        changes: additions/removals will not be handled
    * Enabled by default if scala is present in project, disable by
      setting `typedViewHolders := false`, requires `typedResources` to
      be enabled.
  * Typed resources are no longer generated for aar by default,
    re-enable by setting `typedResourcesAar := true`; build performance
    improvements
* `1.6.6`:
  * handle vector drawable rasterization for `24.0.0` support libraries
  * fix `proguardCache` change check
  * allow using `android-install` and `android-update` commands in
    non-android projects
  * fix incremental builds with vector drawable rasterization
* `1.6.5`:
  * Usability fix for `proguardCache` rules changing; automatically force
    clean build when the rules are changed
  * Implement support for `resConfigs` see [resource shrinking](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/resource-shrinking)
* `1.6.4`:
  * Do not enable `dexInProcess` unless explicitly turned on (fails in too
    many configurations to enable automatically)
* `1.6.3`:
  * Further bugfixes around android builder initialization
  * add `dexMainClassesRules` to set keep rules for dex main file
  * add `typedResourcesFull` to toggle full TR feature support
  * add `aaptPngCrunch` to toggle automatic pngcrunch in aapt
  * auto-enable `dexInProcess` if max heap assigned to SBT is >= 2gb
  * some performance improvements by memoizing reflective calls
* `1.6.2`:
  * Fix automatic maindexlist.txt generation
  * Add more workarounds for race conditions in android builder code
  * Rename `android:install-sdk` and `android:update-sdk` to `android-install`
    and `android-update`, respectively
* `1.6.1`: major new features in a `.1` release!
  * Automatic Android SDK installation
    * `sdkPath` will be set to `~/.android/sbt/sdk` if `ANDROID_HOME` or
      other methods of determining it are not available
    * `platformTarget` will be automatically downloaded if not already
      installed
    * `build-tools` are automatically installed if not already available
    * google and android support repositories are automatically update-checked
      and installed if not already installed when using play services or
      support libs
    * NDK is automatically installed if `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` is not set,
      `ndk-bundle` is not present, and an NDK build is detected (`Android.mk`)
    * SDK installation has a progress indicator, can be suppressed using
      `showSdkProgress := false`
    * SDK management commands added: `android:install-sdk`,
      `android:update-sdk`, and `android-license`
  * `activity-alias` is supported for `android:run` with full tab completion
  * Default `minSdkVersion` is now set to 9 if it is not otherwise set
  * Fix TR generation when `.files` are present in resource directories
  * Fix some TR deprecation warnings
  * Support looking up `ndk-bundle` in `ANDROID_HOME` when `ANDROID_NDK_HOME`
    is not set
  * Bugfix around resource merging when aars are updated (SNAPSHOTS)
  * Bugfix lint no longer fails to run if `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable
    is not set
  * Bugfix unable to `android:run` after `clean` without `compile` first
  * Updated to android builder `2.1.0`
  * Update to retrolambda `2.3.0`
  * Miscellaneous refactoring and code improvements
  * Be more verbose when an SDK java command fails
  * Removed use of `useSdkProguard`, Android SDK proguard rules will always
    be applied in addition to scala-specific rules

      installed SDK)
* `1.6.0`: no longer published to `com.hanhuy.sbt % android-sdk-plugin`
  * TR enhancements
    * on-device performance optimizations (inlining, value classes)
    * full typed resource treatment for all resource types: animations, attrs,
      booleans, colors, dimens, drawables, fractions, integers, interpolators,
      menus, mipmaps, plurals, raws, strings, styles, transitions, xmls and
      all arrays
    * typeclass support for calling `.value` on any TR resource
  * Updated to android builder 2.0.0
  * Remove direct dependency on proguard, allowing configurability by the
    consuming project
  * NDK build improvements
    * `ndkEnv` setting to pass a list of `(ENV,VALUE)` to `ndk-build`
    * `ndkArgs` setting to pass additional arguments to `ndk-build`
  * Performance improvements during `android:dex` (particularly when
    `dexShards := true` )
  * Automatically save last-known `ANDROID_HOME` and `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` values
  * `gen-android` no longer generates `Build.scala` using `android.AutoBuild`
    * `android.AutoBuild` is now deprecated [sbt/sbt#2524](https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/2524)
  * Numerous android-related `TaskKey` converted to `SettingKey`, improves
    performance
  * Performance and usability improvements in tab-completion for repl commands
    * on-device file completion works much more reliably and quickly
  * `android-gradle-build` is also renamed to `sbt-android-gradle` and no
    longer requires `android.GradleBuild`

## Changes in 1.5.x (last version: 1.5.20) ##

* `1.5.20`:
  * add `aaptAdditialParams` key and `useSupportVectors` setting group.
    `support-vector-drawable` is now fully usable
  * fix mis-use of `--no-optimize` while dexing, unsupported option and causes
    thread locking issues and crashes on N preview
  * fix `pidcat` for N preview
  * implement `logcat-grep` and `pidcat-grep` commands
* `1.5.19`:
  * add `ndkAbiFilter` to exclude unsupported ABI native libraries from the
    final APK. e.g. `ndkAbiFilter := Seq("armeabi")` will include only
    `armeabi` native libraries. Default is `Nil`, meaning include all ABI.
  * `gen-android` now creates a `sample.scala` under `src/main/scala` and the
    java sample under `src/main/java` is no longer generated.
    * `javacOptions` is also set to target java 1.7 if the current JVM is
      detected to be running Java 8
  * exclude transitive bouncycastle from Android build tools, allows use of
    latest `sbt-pgp`. Override the dependency on
    `"org.bouncycastle" % "bcpkix-jdk15on" % "1.51"` as necessary.
* `1.5.18`:
  * Fix compatibility with sbt `0.13.11`, see sbt/sbt#2476 and sbt/sbt#2354
  * Make rasterizing vector drawables optional, set `renderVectorDrawables` to
    `false` if `minSdkVersion < 21` and using the new `23.2`
    `support-vector-drawable` and `animated-vector-drawable` libraries
  * Default `minSdkVersion` to `7` if not set, keeps in line with `appcompat-v7`
    was previously `1`...
* `1.5.17`:
  * Fix `proguardCache` regression; was requiring both `package.name` and
    `package/name` to be specified in order to function properly
  * Default `targetSdkVersion` to the platform level specified in
    `platformTarget` if not otherwise specified explicitly
* `1.5.16`:
  * Report the project name when hitting the `platformTarget` missing error
  * Fix another race condition regarding R.java generation
  * Fail build load when `androidBuild`* is applied to a project multiple times
* `1.5.15`:
  * Properly show `lint` warnings when no errors are present
  * Fix errors when importing `buildJar` into IntelliJ
* `1.5.14`:
  * check if JNI sources have changed instead of running `ndk-build` blindly
  * move `android-sdk-plugin` generated, global content into `~/.android/sbt`,
    two entries under this location are `exploded-aars` and `predex`.
    * This speeds up builds by re-using existing `aar` packaging and allowing
      `aar` archives to be pre-dexed for use with `protify` and v21+ multidex
* `1.5.13`:
  * Allow duplicate `aar` dependencies in non-diamond project graphs
  * Fix `adb-wifi` for Android 6.0
  * Universally depend on `bootClasspath`
    (meaning custom bootClasspath is now possible)
  * Default `minSdkVersion` to `1` if it is not specified rather than setting to
    `targetSdkVersion`
* `1.5.12`:
  * fix missing sources in `buildJar`'s `packageSrc`
  * try to fix a long-standing bug with `R.java` generation race, make
    `packageResources` depend on `rGenerator`
* `1.5.11`:
  * `classDirectory` is no longer in `unmanagedClasspath`, `sbt-idea` legacy
  * Android builder error messages are now reported as sbt error messages, not warning
  * fix `flavors` and `buildTypes` to set `Global` config scope-axis when one
    is not specified in the setting
  * automatically add src, resource and manifest overlays for all flavors,
    buildTypes, and combined variants
  * update `android.dsl` build script helpers
* `1.5.10`:
  * add `-p` option to `logcat` command to filter by pid
  * also include jars when searching for jni libraries to import (regression fix)
  * fix missing res apk when toggling debug/release builds (regression fix)
* `1.5.9`:
  * Update to android builder `1.5.0`
  * Fix TypedLayoutInflater when inflating into a container
  * Add flavor+buildType source directories/manifest overlays automatically
  * Add `apkDebugSigningConfig`, allows custom debug signing configuration
  * support for rendering `VectorDrawable` to `png` for pre-lollipop, place
    `VectorDrawable`s into `res/drawable` and they will be converted to
    `mdpi`, `hdpi`, `xhdpi` and `xxhdpi` rasters automatically when
    `minSdkVersion` is below 21. Do not put vectors into `drawable-anydpi-v21`,
    those will not get rasterized automatically.
    * To clear the lint errors from using `<vector>` images, add this line into
      lint.xml:
      `<issue id="NewApi"><ignore path="src/main/res/drawable"/></issue>`
  * Can now properly build [u2020](https://github.com/JakeWharton/u2020)
    automatically using `android-gradle-build` and a few settings in `build.sbt`:
    * `retrolambdaEnabled := true`
    * `libraryDependencies += "com.squareup.dagger" % "dagger-compiler" % "1.2.2" % "provided"`
    * `android.dsl.apkExclude("META-INF/services/javax.annotation.processing.Processor")`
* `1.5.8`: minor bugfix release
* `1.5.7`:
  * fix `retrolambda-enable` to `retrolambda-enabled` in repl
  * re-enable `copyResources`
  * Fix issue with `RootProject`s and `dependsOn(androidSubProject)` checking
  * Honor `android:outputLayout` in more places (everywhere?)
  * bring back `FileFunction.cached` for android res on a best-effort basis
  * `android:use-proguard` and `android:use-proguard-in-debug` no longer depend
    on each other
* `1.5.6`:
  * Fix `logcat`, allow passing arguments
  * Load flavor, buildType, applicationId, versionName and code into
    BuildConfig automatically
  * No longer de-duplicate JNI libraries automatically, this must be managed
    using packagingOptions
  * Warn when using `dependsOn(androidSubProject)` incorrectly
* `1.5.5`:
  * warn when aar dependency versions are improperly configured (thanks @tek)
  * colorize `logcat`, force `-v brief` for marshmallow compatibility (fixes
    pidcat for marshmallow as well)
  * cache all common library predexing into `$HOME/.android/predex`;
    project-specific libraries, including all aars, remain in
    `target/intermediates/predex`
  * changed all `android.Keys._` to automatically be `in Android`. It is no
    longer necessary to specify `in Android` when configuring android settings
    * If re-using these keys from another configuration using
      `inConfig(CONFIG)`, then they will need to be explicitly set as
      `androidKey in CONFIG`. Should not affect normal usage.
* `1.5.4`: update checker fix
* `1.5.3`:
  * Fix bug when there are 2 android sub-projects and using a command that
    accepts the `/PROJECT` option (would select the incorrect project)
  * Start work on an experimental `android.dsl` API
* `1.5.2`:
  * Add an entirely new, alternative, `flavors` and `buildTypes` system.
    * Configure by adding `buildTypes in Android += (("name", List(settings)))`
      or the same for `flavors in Android`.
    * Load the variant configuration by using the
      `variant[/PROJECT] [BUILD_TYPE] [FLAVOR]` command, run `variant[/PROJECT]`
       by itself to see current variant status and available flavors and/or
       build types.
      * Alternatively, load a default variant by adding
       `android.Plugin.withVariant("PROJECT-ID", Option("BUILD-TYPE"), Option("FLAVOR"))`
       into `build.sbt`
    * LIMITATIONS: Any `set` command must occur prior to calling `variant` or
      else the `set` command will reset all variant settings
  * warn if `exportJars` is set incorrectly on dependency projects
  * automatically set project for `pidcat`, `adb-runas`, `adb-kill` when
    possible. Also allow appending `/<project>` to any of those commands
    * `adb-kill` now uses `am force-stop` when running against a device api 11+
* `1.5.1`:
  * add `android:debug` command to wait for debugger to connect on app launch
  * properly include assets from transitive aar and apklibs
  * change `androidBuildWith` and `buildWith` to accept `ProjectReference`
    arguments instead of `Project`
  * build optimizations for multi-project builds (more transitive library fixes,
    thanks @tek)
  * ensure consistent usage of `useProguardInDebug`, `proguardScala`, etc.
    * fix `typedResources` to default to the value of `autoScalaLibrary` not
      `proguardScala`
  * turn `lintFlags` into a task, rather than setting
  * add `predexSkip` defaults to all local library projects, defines jars
    which should be included in main dex (for sharding, etc)
* `1.5.0`:
  * build outputs completely refactored, `genPath`, `binPath`, and other
    settings have been removed; outputs are completely configurable by setting
    `outputLayout in Android` to a function `ProjectLayout => BuildOutput`
    ```
    outputLayout in Android := {
      val base = (outputLayout in Android).value
      (p: ProjectLayout) => new android.BuildOutput.Wrapped(base(p)) {
        // example: changes default from "target/android/intermediates"
        // to "build/steps"
        override def intermediates = p.base / "build" / "steps"
      }
    }
    ```
    * Project flavor build outputs also updated (no longer go into
      `flavor-target`, instead just `flavor/`), no longer work in conjunction
      with `android.AutoBuild`, `androidBuild` must be explicitly set when
      working with flavors.
  * `apkbuildExcludes` and `apkbuildPickFirsts` have been removed,
    use `packagingOptions in Android` in conjunction with the
    `PackagingOptions` object
  * Renamed `dexMainFileClasses`, `dexMinimizeMainFile`, and
    `dexMainFileClassesConfig` to `dexMainClasses`, `dexMinimizeMain`,
    and `dexMainClassesConfig`, respectively.
  * Renamed `retrolambdaEnable` to `retrolambdaEnabled`
  * Add `extraAssetDirectories`
  * Dex sharding with `minSdkVersion` 21 or higher, dramatically improves
    incremental build times, enable by setting `dexShards in Android := true`
    * Add `dexLegacyMode` to set when predexing optimizations and sharding are
      disabled; automatically true when `minSdkVersion` < 21
    * Disabled parallel dx from `1.4.14`, it creates too much of a cpu/memory load
  * Add `inProjectScope(project)(settings...)` to make it easier to configure
    multi-project builds

## New features in 1.4.x (last version: 1.4.15) ##

* `1.4.14`:
  * Multi-project multi-dex fixes for OSX
  * Parallelized pre-dexing
* `1.4.13`:
  * `android:install` and `android:uninstall` now respect `android:allDevices`
  * add `android:clean` for clearing app data from device

  * fix `mainDexClasses` on non-Windows platforms
  * implement `android.GradleBuild` in `"com.hanhuy.sbt" % "android-gradle-build" % "0.2"`
    * Automatic building from gradle projects without having to configure SBT
    * See the [gradle-build test cases](sbt-test/gradle-build)
      for an example of usage
    * Known issue: transitive aar libraries that are specified in both library
      and app modules will fail to build
  * use `AutoPlugin` triggers
* `1.4.10`:
  * Set `autoScalaLibrary` based on presence of scala sources
  * Set `minSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion` based on `platformTarget`
    unless explicitly specified in `AndroidManifest.xml`, previously defaulted
    to 1
  * Properly skip `dex` if files unchanged.
  * `retrolambdaEnable` is set false by default
  * More refactoring to support Protify, see
    [live-code demo](https://youtu.be/4MaGxkqopII)
* `1.4.9`:
  * add color to pid in `pidcat`
  * fix flavor target directory when flavoring a subproject
  * suppress lint error in androidBuildJar
  * fix `javacOptions in doc`
  * turn update checker into `updateCheck in Android` which can be set to `()`
    to squelch
  * refactoring to support [Protify](https://github.com/pfn/protify), see demos
    [Protify Layout Prototyper Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgT9RA4SONU)
    and [Protify Code Prototyper Demo](https://youtu.be/g63I87UZ6bg?t=3m10s)
* `1.4.8`:
  * Update to new android gradle/builder 1.3.0
    * add `libraryRequests` and `packagingOptions` settings
  * warn about performance when using generated `maindexlist.txt`
  * add `androidBuildJar` and `buildJar` for creating jar libraries without
    resources (anytime aar or apklib is not required).
  * automatically cleanup resources when aar/apklib dependencies are changed,
    no longer requires clean build after changes.
* `1.4.7`:
  * proguard + cache improvements:
    * no longer need to clean after updating proguard and/or cache rules
  * add `android:allDevices` for automatically executing `android:install`,
    `android:run`, and/or `android:test` against all connected devices
  * lots of code cleanup (remove bad uses of `sbt.State`
  * improve the output of `devices` (include api level and battery status)
  * move the output of `AndroidBuilder` into `debug`
  * re-expose `sdkPath`, also add `ndkPath` as a setting
  * fix `watchSources` to properly compile on resource, jni, ndk, etc. changes
  * deprecate `androidBuildApklib`, should use `androidBuildAar` instead
  * fail the build when trying to run library projects
  * automatically generate `maindexlist.txt` if `dexMainFileClasses in Android`
    is not set
* `1.4.6`:
  * rename `android:packageName` to `android:applicationId`,
    uses `android:packageName` if set, otherwise falls back to value in
    `android:manifest`. `android:packageName` is reverted to be a
    `SettingKey` to fix collision with `sbt-native-packager`; fixes #178
  * add `resValues in Android`; allow specifying res/values from build (for
    flavors and auto-generated resources); analogous to `resValue` from the
    gradle android plugin.
* `1.4.5`:
  * colorize `pidcat` command
  * fix several proguard cache related bugs (minor)
  * organize predex bin output better
* `1.4.4`:
  * minor NDK build improvements
  * add testSources to watchSources (automatically trigger ~ commands)
* `1.4.3`:
  * `logcat` and `pidcat` performance improvements
  * minor signing config fixes (fix clobbering of settings, only prompt
    passwords once)
  * Instrumentation testing: do not squelch `testAndroidTestCaseSetUpProperly`
* `1.4.2`:
  * multidex updates
    * Allow proguard/proguardCache in conjunction with multidex
    * Implement minSdkVersion=21+ multidex optimizations (dramatically improve
      incremental build times when using multidex)
* `1.4.1`:
  * add a dex method counter, spits out number of methods in all dex files,
    aids in deciding when to add additional proguard-cache rules, and switching
    to/from multi-dex
  * Enhanced proguard-cache jar processing, no longer messes up conflicting
    case-sensitive filenames (can now proguard-cache obfuscated jars)
  * Fix apklibs source generators when using build flavors
* `1.4.0`:
  * This version **is not entirely backward compatible** with 1.3.x; `TR.scala`
    and `proguardCache` have undergone significant changes.
  * Some code re-organization, internal settings hidden from public view (can
    still be accessed by defining SettingKey and TaskKey manually as required)
  * Add `android:bootClasspath` for use with robolectric
  * Unused resource shrinker, enable with `shrinkResources in Android := true`
    * Only runs if proguard is run, typically used for clean, release builds.
    * See the
      [resource shrinking documentation](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/resource-shrinking)
  * Conversion of some settings to tasks: `packageName`, `manifest`,
    `packageForR`, `versionName`, `versionCode`, `minSdkVersion`,
    `targetSdkVersion`
    * See all [available keys](src/keys.scala)
  * TypedResource improvements, now uses value class extensions for runtime
    performance improvements (all apps must now use scala 2.10+)
    * Renamed `TypedViewHolder` in favor of a single `TypedFindView`,
      removed `TypedView`, `TypedActivity`, `TypedActivityHolder`, `TypedDialog`
  * Proguard cache improvements, no more `ProguardCache` DSL, instead, add
    package prefix strings to cache directly to `proguardCache in Android`
    (`Seq[String]`)
  * Add `extraResDirectories` setting for additional overlay-resources. For use
    with build flavors, etc.

## New features in 1.3.x (last version: 1.3.24) ##

* `1.3.24`:
  * Minor lint fix (honor min/target sdk from build file)
  * Last version to support scala 2.8.x and 2.9.x
* `1.3.23`:
  * Remove repeated lint output
  * Fix `android.Plugin.flavorOf`
    * Demonstrate usage of `flavorOf` along with junit4 instrumented testing
      in the [android-test-kit test case](sbt-test/android-sdk-plugin/android-test-kit)
  * Fix doubled update checker message
  * Update `com.android.tools.build` and `lint` dependencies
* `1.3.22`:
  * Initial lint support
    * Configured to only detect API level issues by default
    * New setting keys:
      * `android:lintEnabled`: run lint in `compile`, default true
      * `android:lintFlags`: optional flags for lint
      * `android:lintStrict`: fail the build on lint errors, default false
      * `android:lintDetectors`: lint rules to detect, default: API level issues
    * New task `android:lint`: run lint independently of compile, will not run
      compile before-hand, otherwise, behaves according to settings above.
    * Available lint detectors can be found documented at
      http://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.android.tools.lint/lint-checks/24.2.2
  * Update to `com.android.tools.build:builder:1.2.0`
  * Remove stack traces on build failures (stack traces for errors only)

    * Simple usage is `lazy val flavorproject = android.Plugin.flavorOf(baseproject,
     "flavor-name", flavorSettings /* copies and override baseproject settings */)`
    * The `flavorproject` is otherwise a normal sbt project and it can be treated
      as such.
* `1.3.17`:
  * Reimplemented `renderscript` task, thanks @zbsz
  * Update checker fixes
  * Fork the retrolambda process for google play services failures

    * Automatically enabled when JDK 8 and java sources are detected.
    * Manually enable by setting `retrolambdaEnable in Android := true` (or,
      conversely, `false` to disable if it was automatically enabled)
    * Sample in
      [simple-retrolambda test case](sbt-test/android-sdk-plugin/simple-retrolambda)

  * split `test` from `android:test` (better support for robolectric)
  * manifest placeholders, set `manifestPlaceholders in Android`
    * `Map[String,String]` for `key:value`s to replace in AndroidManifest.xml
    * Placeholders are expanded using `${key}` syntax
    * Can be dynamically configured as it is implemented as an SBT task
* `1.3.11`:
  * multidex support (thank you @dant3) see
    [the android reference documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/multidex/MultiDex.html)
    and the
   [hello-multidex test case](sbt-test/android-sdk-plugin/hello-multidex)
    for an example of usage
  * `adb-runas` command: run a command as the current development package user
* `1.3.10`:
  * `adb-kill` command: kill the currently running package process
    (if not foreground)
  * update android builder (0.14.2), proguard (5.0) and asm dependencies (5.0)
  * `1.3.7`, `1.3.8` and `1.3.9` are bad releases, moderate bugs
* `1.3.5`:
  * Last release for sbt `0.12.x`
  * unseal ProjectLayout
  * allow proguard-cache on java-only projects
  * `adb-screenon` command (turn screen of device on/unlock)
  * include renderscript generated resources in aar
* `1.3.4`: bugfixes
  * #81 add fullClasspath to javah
  * update to builder 0.12.2
  * #82 add NDK_PROJECT_PATH environment for ndkbuild
  * #84 package dependsOn managedResources
  * #85 sourceManaged = gen
  * minor ndk build fixes (apkbuild depends on *.so)
* `1.3.3`: Add `ApkSigningConfig`, `PlainSigningConfig`,
  `PromptStorepassSigningConfig` and `PromptPasswordsSigningConfig`. These
   various signing configurations allow control over prompting for keystore
   and key passwords. The default is `PlainSigningConfig` which observes the
   original behavior from ant builds (reads properties out of
   `local.properties`). Set `apkSigningConfig in Android` to one of these
   variants to perform non-default behavior.
   * Also added `androidBuildWith()` project decorator, replaces
    `androidBuild(projects)` and `dependsOn(projects)`
* `1.3.2`: add `AutoPlugin` support for `0.13.5`
  * Auto-set `localProjects` when using `android.Plugin.androidBuild(...)`
  * When `gen-android`, `gen-android`, and `android.AutoBuild` require `0.13.5`
    if on the `0.13.x` sbt line.
  * Some refactoring of classes out of `android.Keys`, should be mostly
    compatible still.
* `1.3.1`: add `android:apkbuild-pickfirsts` works like
  `android:apkbuild-excludes` but picks the first occurrence of the resource.
  * A bug in com.android.tools.build:builder,
    [android bug #73437](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=73437),
    prevents PackagingOptions from working correctly with JNI libraries.
  A workaround is implemented copy all JNI to a single location first.
* NDK build process, similarly to `ANDROID_HOME`, set `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` to
  the location where the Android NDK is installed. Alternatively, `ndk.dir`
  can be set in a `local.properties` file for the project.
  * libs will be generated into `binPath / "jni"` and
    obj will drop into `binPath / "obj"`
  * Pre-generated JNI libraries will no longer be pulled out of `jni`
    (nor `src/main/jni`) -- they will be taken from `libs` (or `src/main/libs`)
    * This does not apply to aar and apklib--they will be pulled out of
      appropriate locations per their spec.
  * `javah` is automatically executed on all classes that have `native` methods
    in their signatures. The header files are generated into `sourceManaged`
    and are available to include in native sources and `Android.mk` by adding
    `LOCAL_CFLAGS := -I$(SBT_SOURCE_MANAGED)`
  * `collect-jni` no longer copies libraries, it only assembles a list of
    directory names for packaging
* Global plugin installation friendly
  * For sbt 0.13, add to `~/.sbt/0.13/plugins/android.sbt`
  * `addSbtPlugin("com.hanhuy.sbt" % "android-sdk-plugin" % "1.4.15")`
* New commands, all commands have proper tab-completion:
  * `gen-android` - creates android projects from scratch with sbt plumbing
  * `gen-android-sbt` - creates SBT files for an existing android project
  * `logcat` - supports all regular options, non-polling (-d by default)
  * `pidcat` - logcat the current package or specified package with TAG filters
  * `adb-ls` - ls on-device
  * `adb-cat` - cat a file on-device
  * `adb-rm` - rm a file on-device
  * `adb-shell` - execute a shell command on-device
  * `adb-push` - push a file to device
  * `adb-pull` - pull a file from device
  * `reboot-device` renamed to `adb-reboot`
* Existing commands available globally
  * `devices`, `device`, `adb-wifi`
* `AutoBuild` support, (created automatically with `gen-android`), set your
  build to be `object Build extends android.AutoBuild` and settings will be
  automatically applied to projects as necessary.
* Update to latest `com.android.tools.build` `0.12.x`
  * Now requires android build-tools `19.1.0` or newer
* `minSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion` are now `SettingKey[String]` and no
  longer `SettingKey[Int]` (support android-L)
* Instrumentation tests are now located in `src/main/androidTest` instead of
  `src/main/instrumentTest` (match layout generated by android create project)
* `android:dex` task now returns a folder for the output dex not a `classes.dex`
  file.

## New features in 1.2.x (last version: 1.2.20) ##

* Add setting `android:debug-includes-tests` (default = true) to automatically
  include instrumented test cases in the debug APK instead of using a separate
  test APK. This feature improves IntelliJ testing integration.
  * As a result of this new feature, if there are any `libraryDependencies` in
    `test` that must be honored, the setting must be disabled, and a separate
    test APK must be created. An alternative is to include the test dependencies
    in the normal compile. Proguard will automatically strip these out in
    release builds if they are unused.
  * This setting may be ignored, or set to `false` if one does not have tests
    or does not want to include the test cases in the debug package.
  * If the setting is disabled, test cases will be generated into a test APK
    when running `android:test`
  * When generating release builds, it is important to `clean`, otherwise
    test artifacts may be left over and present in the released apk.
  * When using included tests, it is necessary to add the following proguard
    options, or else proguard will mistakenly remove test cases from the
    output:

    ```
    proguardOptions in Android ++= Seq(
      "-keep public class * extends junit.framework.TestCase",
      "-keepclassmembers class * extends junit.framework.TestCase { *; }"
    )
    ```
* Add ability to disable manifest merging if upstream libraries have bad
  manifest settings, set `mergeManifests in Android := false`, default is
  `true`
  * Disabling manifest merging will remove automatic import of Activities,
    Services, BroadcastReceivers, etc. from the library's manifest into the
    main application manifest
* Increase test timeout to 3 minutes, from 5 seconds, configurable by using the
  `instrumentTestTimeout` setting key, in milliseconds
* `1.2.18`: `zipalignPath` has changed from a Setting into a Task
